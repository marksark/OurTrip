# OurTrip

This project was created because my friends and I love camping together.

This application is used to track where we want to go camping and who is able to join our trip.
It can also be used to post photos in order to encourage friends to visit the natural beauty around them.

I am the sole developer of this project.

A current live version can be found at OurTripByMarkSarkis.herokuapp.com
